		       <span class="s0">Version 2.1, February 1999</span>

 <span class="s0">Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span>
     <span class="s0">59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</span>
 <span class="s0">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span>
 <span class="s0">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span>

<span class="s0">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</span>
 <span class="s0">as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</span>
 <span class="s0">the version number 2.1.]</span>

			    <span class="s0">Preamble</span>

  <span class="s0">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span>
<span class="s0">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span>
<span class="s0">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</span>
<span class="s0">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</span>

  <span class="s0">This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</span>
<span class="s0">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</span>
<span class="s0">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</span>
<span class="s0">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</span>
<span class="s0">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</span>
<span class="s0">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</span>

  <span class="s0">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</span>
<span class="s0">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</span>
<span class="s0">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</span>
<span class="s0">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</span>
<span class="s0">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</span>
<span class="s0">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</span>
<span class="s0">these things.</span>

  <span class="s0">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span>
<span class="s0">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</span>
<span class="s0">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</span>
<span class="s0">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</span>

  <span class="s0">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<span class="s0">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<span class="s0">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<span class="s0">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</span>
<span class="s0">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</span>
<span class="s0">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<span class="s0">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>

  <span class="s0">We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</span>
<span class="s0">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</span>
<span class="s0">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>

  <span class="s0">To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</span>
<span class="s0">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</span>
<span class="s0">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</span>
<span class="s0">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</span>
<span class="s0">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</span>
<span class="s0">introduced by others.</span>

  <span class="s0">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</span>
<span class="s0">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</span>
<span class="s0">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</span>
<span class="s0">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</span>
<span class="s0">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</span>
<span class="s0">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</span>

  <span class="s0">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</span>
<span class="s0">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</span>
<span class="s0">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</span>
<span class="s0">libraries into non-free programs.</span>

  <span class="s0">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</span>
<span class="s0">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</span>
<span class="s0">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</span>
<span class="s0">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</span>
<span class="s0">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</span>
<span class="s0">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</span>
<span class="s0">the library.</span>

  <span class="s0">We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</span>
<span class="s0">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</span>
<span class="s0">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</span>
<span class="s0">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</span>
<span class="s0">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</span>
<span class="s0">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</span>
<span class="s0">special circumstances.</span>

  <span class="s0">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</span>
<span class="s0">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</span>
<span class="s0">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</span>
<span class="s0">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</span>
<span class="s0">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</span>
<span class="s0">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</span>
<span class="s0">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</span>

  <span class="s0">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</span>
<span class="s0">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</span>
<span class="s0">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</span>
<span class="s0">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</span>
<span class="s0">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</span>
<span class="s0">system.</span>

  <span class="s0">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</span>
<span class="s0">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</span>
<span class="s0">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</span>
<span class="s0">that program using a modified version of the Library.</span>

  <span class="s0">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span>
<span class="s0">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</span>
<span class="s0">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</span>
<span class="s0">be combined with the library in order to run.</span>

		  <span class="s0">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
   <span class="s0">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span>

  <span class="s0">0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</span>
<span class="s0">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</span>
<span class="s0">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</span>
<span class="s0">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</span>
<span class="s0">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>

  <span class="s0">A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</span>
<span class="s0">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</span>
<span class="s0">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</span>

  <span class="s0">The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</span>
<span class="s0">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</span>
<span class="s0">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</span>
<span class="s0">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</span>
<span class="s0">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</span>
<span class="s0">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</span>

  <span class="s0">&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="s0">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</span>
<span class="s0">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</span>
<span class="s0">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</span>
<span class="s0">and installation of the library.</span>

  <span class="s0">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
<span class="s0">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</span>
<span class="s0">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</span>
<span class="s0">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</span>
<span class="s0">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</span>
<span class="s0">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</span>
<span class="s0">and what the program that uses the Library does.</span>
  
  <span class="s0">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's</span>
<span class="s0">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</span>
<span class="s0">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</span>
<span class="s0">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</span>
<span class="s0">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</span>
<span class="s0">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</span>
<span class="s0">Library.</span>

  <span class="s0">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</span>
<span class="s0">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</span>
<span class="s0">fee.</span>

  <span class="s0">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</span>
<span class="s0">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</span>
<span class="s0">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span>
<span class="s0">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</span>
    <span class="s0">stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</span>
    <span class="s0">charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</span>

    <span class="s0">d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</span>
    <span class="s0">table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</span>
    <span class="s0">the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</span>
    <span class="s0">is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</span>
    <span class="s0">in the event an application does not supply such function or</span>
    <span class="s0">table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</span>
    <span class="s0">its purpose remains meaningful.</span>

    <span class="s0">(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</span>
    <span class="s0">a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</span>
    <span class="s0">application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span>
    <span class="s0">application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span>
    <span class="s0">be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</span>
    <span class="s0">root function must still compute square roots.)</span>

<span class="s0">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span>
<span class="s0">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</span>
<span class="s0">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span>
<span class="s0">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span>
<span class="s0">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span>
<span class="s0">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
<span class="s0">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span>
<span class="s0">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span class="s0">it.</span>

<span class="s0">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span>
<span class="s0">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span>
<span class="s0">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span>
<span class="s0">collective works based on the Library.</span>

<span class="s0">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</span>
<span class="s0">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</span>
<span class="s0">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span>
<span class="s0">the scope of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</span>
<span class="s0">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</span>
<span class="s0">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</span>
<span class="s0">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</span>
<span class="s0">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</span>
<span class="s0">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</span>
<span class="s0">these notices.</span>

  <span class="s0">Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</span>
<span class="s0">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</span>
<span class="s0">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</span>

  <span class="s0">This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</span>
<span class="s0">the Library into a program that is not a library.</span>

  <span class="s0">4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</span>
<span class="s0">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</span>
<span class="s0">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</span>
<span class="s0">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</span>
<span class="s0">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</span>
<span class="s0">medium customarily used for software interchange.</span>

  <span class="s0">If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="s0">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>
<span class="s0">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
<span class="s0">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span>

  <span class="s0">5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</span>
<span class="s0">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</span>
<span class="s0">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</span>
<span class="s0">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</span>
<span class="s0">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</span>
<span class="s0">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</span>
<span class="s0">contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="s0">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</span>
<span class="s0">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</span>

  <span class="s0">When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</span>
<span class="s0">that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</span>
<span class="s0">derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</span>
<span class="s0">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</span>
<span class="s0">linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</span>
<span class="s0">threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</span>

  <span class="s0">If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</span>
<span class="s0">structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</span>
<span class="s0">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</span>
<span class="s0">file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</span>
<span class="s0">work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</span>
<span class="s0">Library will still fall under Section 6.)</span>

  <span class="s0">Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</span>
<span class="s0">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</span>
<span class="s0">whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</span>

  <span class="s0">6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or</span>
<span class="s0">link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</span>
<span class="s0">work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</span>
<span class="s0">under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</span>
<span class="s0">modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse</span>
<span class="s0">engineering for debugging such modifications.</span>

  <span class="s0">You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</span>
<span class="s0">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</span>
<span class="s0">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</span>
<span class="s0">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</span>
<span class="s0">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</span>
<span class="s0">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</span>
<span class="s0">of these things:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</span>
    <span class="s0">machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</span>
    <span class="s0">changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</span>
    <span class="s0">Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span>
    <span class="s0">with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</span>
    <span class="s0">uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</span>
    <span class="s0">user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span>
    <span class="s0">executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</span>
    <span class="s0">that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span>
    <span class="s0">Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</span>
    <span class="s0">to use the modified definitions.)</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</span>
    <span class="s0">Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</span>
    <span class="s0">copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,</span>
    <span class="s0">rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</span>
    <span class="s0">will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</span>
    <span class="s0">the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</span>
    <span class="s0">interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</span>

    <span class="s0">c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</span>
    <span class="s0">least three years, to give the same user the materials</span>
    <span class="s0">specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</span>
    <span class="s0">than the cost of performing this distribution.</span>

    <span class="s0">d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span>
    <span class="s0">from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span>
    <span class="s0">specified materials from the same place.</span>

    <span class="s0">e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</span>
    <span class="s0">materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span>

  <span class="s0">For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="s0">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</span>
<span class="s0">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</span>
<span class="s0">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</span>
<span class="s0">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</span>
<span class="s0">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</span>
<span class="s0">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</span>
<span class="s0">the executable.</span>

  <span class="s0">It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</span>
<span class="s0">accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</span>
<span class="s0">use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</span>
<span class="s0">distribute.</span>

  <span class="s0">7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</span>
<span class="s0">facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</span>
<span class="s0">library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</span>
<span class="s0">the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</span>
<span class="s0">permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</span>

    <span class="s0">a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</span>
    <span class="s0">based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</span>
    <span class="s0">facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</span>
    <span class="s0">Sections above.</span>

    <span class="s0">b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</span>
    <span class="s0">that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</span>
    <span class="s0">where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span>

  <span class="s0">8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</span>
<span class="s0">the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</span>
<span class="s0">attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</span>
<span class="s0">rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</span>
<span class="s0">or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</span>
<span class="s0">terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</span>

  <span class="s0">9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
<span class="s0">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span>
<span class="s0">distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
<span class="s0">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span>
<span class="s0">modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
<span class="s0">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span>
<span class="s0">the Library or works based on it.</span>

  <span class="s0">10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="s0">Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="s0">original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</span>
<span class="s0">subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
<span class="s0">restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</span>
<span class="s0">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with</span>
<span class="s0">this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
<span class="s0">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span>
<span class="s0">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span>
<span class="s0">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span>
<span class="s0">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</span>
<span class="s0">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span>
<span class="s0">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span>
<span class="s0">may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="s0">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</span>
<span class="s0">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span>
<span class="s0">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span>
<span class="s0">refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</span>

<span class="s0">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</span>
<span class="s0">particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</span>
<span class="s0">and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span>

<span class="s0">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</span>
<span class="s0">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</span>
<span class="s0">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</span>
<span class="s0">integrity of the free software distribution system which is</span>
<span class="s0">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</span>
<span class="s0">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</span>
<span class="s0">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</span>
<span class="s0">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</span>
<span class="s0">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</span>
<span class="s0">impose that choice.</span>

<span class="s0">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span>
<span class="s0">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</span>
<span class="s0">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</span>
<span class="s0">original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</span>
<span class="s0">an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</span>
<span class="s0">so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</span>
<span class="s0">excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</span>
<span class="s0">written in the body of this License.</span>

  <span class="s0">13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</span>
<span class="s0">versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.</span>
<span class="s0">Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</span>
<span class="s0">but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span>

<span class="s0">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</span>
<span class="s0">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</span>
<span class="s0">conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</span>
<span class="s0">the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</span>
<span class="s0">license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</span>
<span class="s0">the Free Software Foundation.</span>

  <span class="s0">14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</span>
<span class="s0">programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</span>
<span class="s0">write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</span>
<span class="s0">copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</span>
<span class="s0">Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</span>
<span class="s0">decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</span>
<span class="s0">of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</span>
<span class="s0">and reuse of software generally.</span>

			    <span class="s0">NO WARRANTY</span>

  <span class="s0">15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</span>
<span class="s0">WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</span>
<span class="s0">EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</span>
<span class="s0">OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</span>
<span class="s0">KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</span>
<span class="s0">IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</span>
<span class="s0">PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</span>
<span class="s0">LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</span>
<span class="s0">THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>

  <span class="s0">16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</span>
<span class="s0">WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</span>
<span class="s0">AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</span>
<span class="s0">FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</span>
<span class="s0">CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</span>
<span class="s0">LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING</span>
<span class="s0">RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A</span>
<span class="s0">FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF</span>
<span class="s0">SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</span>
<span class="s0">DAMAGES.</span>

           <span class="s0">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</span>

  <span class="s0">If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>
<span class="s0">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</span>
<span class="s0">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</span>
<span class="s0">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</span>
<span class="s0">ordinary General Public License).</span>

  <span class="s0">To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</span>
<span class="s0">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
<span class="s0">convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>

    <span class="s0">&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
    <span class="s0">Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span>

    <span class="s0">This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or</span>
    <span class="s0">modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public</span>
    <span class="s0">License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either</span>
    <span class="s0">version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</span>

    <span class="s0">This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span>
    <span class="s0">but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</span>
    <span class="s0">MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU</span>
    <span class="s0">Lesser General Public License for more details.</span>

    <span class="s0">You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public</span>
    <span class="s0">License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software</span>
    <span class="s0">Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</span>

<span class="s0">Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</span>

<span class="s0">You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your</span>
<span class="s0">school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if</span>
<span class="s0">necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</span>

  <span class="s0">Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the</span>
  <span class="s0">library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</span>

  <span class="s0">&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990</span>
  <span class="s0">Ty Coon, President of Vice</span>

<span class="s0">That's all there is to it!</span>
