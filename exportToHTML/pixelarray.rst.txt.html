<span class="s0">:class:`pygame.PixelArray`</span>
<span class="s0">==========================</span>

<span class="s0">.. currentmodule:: pygame</span>

<span class="s0">.. class:: PixelArray</span>

   <span class="s0">| :sl:`pygame object for direct pixel access of surfaces`</span>
   <span class="s0">| :sg:`PixelArray(Surface) -&gt; PixelArray`</span>

   <span class="s0">The PixelArray wraps a Surface and provides direct access to the</span>
   <span class="s0">surface's pixels. A pixel array can be one or two dimensional.</span>
   <span class="s0">A two dimensional array, like its surface, is indexed [column, row].</span>
   <span class="s0">Pixel arrays support slicing, both for returning a subarray or</span>
   <span class="s0">for assignment. A pixel array sliced on a single column or row</span>
   <span class="s0">returns a one dimensional pixel array. Arithmetic and other operations</span>
   <span class="s0">are not supported. A pixel array can be safely assigned to itself.</span>
   <span class="s0">Finally, pixel arrays export an array struct interface, allowing</span>
   <span class="s0">them to interact with :mod:`pygame.pixelcopy` methods and NumPy</span>
   <span class="s0">arrays.</span>

   <span class="s0">A PixelArray pixel item can be assigned a raw integer values, a</span>
   <span class="s0">:class:`pygame.Color` instance, or a (r, g, b[, a]) tuple.</span>

   <span class="s0">::</span>

     <span class="s0">pxarray[x, y] = 0xFF00FF</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[x, y] = pygame.Color(255, 0, 255)</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[x, y] = (255, 0, 255)</span>

   <span class="s0">However, only a pixel's integer value is returned. So, to compare a pixel</span>
   <span class="s0">to a particular color the color needs to be first mapped using</span>
   <span class="s0">the :meth:`Surface.map_rgb()` method of the Surface object for which the</span>
   <span class="s0">PixelArray was created.</span>

   <span class="s0">::</span>

     <span class="s0">pxarray = pygame.PixelArray(surface)</span>
     <span class="s0"># Check, if the first pixel at the topleft corner is blue</span>
     <span class="s0">if pxarray[0, 0] == surface.map_rgb((0, 0, 255)):</span>
         <span class="s0">...</span>

   <span class="s0">When assigning to a range of of pixels, a non tuple sequence of colors or</span>
   <span class="s0">a PixelArray can be used as the value. For a sequence, the length must</span>
   <span class="s0">match the PixelArray width.</span>

   <span class="s0">::</span>

     <span class="s0">pxarray[a:b] = 0xFF00FF                   # set all pixels to 0xFF00FF</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[a:b] = (0xFF00FF, 0xAACCEE, ... ) # first pixel = 0xFF00FF,</span>
                                               <span class="s0"># second pixel  = 0xAACCEE, ...</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[a:b] = [(255, 0, 255), (170, 204, 238), ...] # same as above</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[a:b] = [(255, 0, 255), 0xAACCEE, ...]        # same as above</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[a:b] = otherarray[x:y]            # slice sizes must match</span>

   <span class="s0">For PixelArray assignment, if the right hand side array has a row length</span>
   <span class="s0">of 1, then the column is broadcast over the target array's rows. An</span>
   <span class="s0">array of height 1 is broadcast over the target's columns, and is equivalent</span>
   <span class="s0">to assigning a 1D PixelArray.</span>

   <span class="s0">Subscript slices can also be used to assign to a rectangular subview of</span>
   <span class="s0">the target PixelArray.</span>

   <span class="s0">::</span>

     <span class="s0"># Create some new PixelArray objects providing a different view</span>
     <span class="s0"># of the original array/surface.</span>
     <span class="s0">newarray = pxarray[2:4, 3:5]</span>
     <span class="s0">otherarray = pxarray[::2, ::2]</span>

   <span class="s0">Subscript slices can also be used to do fast rectangular pixel manipulations</span>
   <span class="s0">instead of iterating over the x or y axis. The</span>

   <span class="s0">::</span>

     <span class="s0">pxarray[::2, :] = (0, 0, 0)               # Make even columns black.</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[::2] = (0, 0, 0)                  # Same as [::2, :]</span>

   <span class="s0">During its lifetime, the PixelArray locks the surface, thus you explicitly</span>
   <span class="s0">have to close() it once its not used any more and the surface should perform</span>
   <span class="s0">operations in the same scope. It is best to use it as a context manager</span>
   <span class="s0">using the with PixelArray(surf) as pixel_array: style. So it works on pypy too.</span>

   <span class="s0">A simple ``:`` slice index for the column can be omitted.</span>

   <span class="s0">::</span>

     <span class="s0">pxarray[::2, ...] = (0, 0, 0)             # Same as pxarray[::2, :]</span>
     <span class="s0">pxarray[...] = (255, 0, 0)                # Same as pxarray[:]</span>

   <span class="s0">A note about PixelArray to PixelArray assignment, for arrays with an</span>
   <span class="s0">item size of 3 (created from 24 bit surfaces) pixel values are translated</span>
   <span class="s0">from the source to the destinations format. The red, green, and blue</span>
   <span class="s0">color elements of each pixel are shifted to match the format of the</span>
   <span class="s0">target surface. For all other pixel sizes no such remapping occurs.</span>
   <span class="s0">This should change in later pygame releases, where format conversions</span>
   <span class="s0">are performed for all pixel sizes. To avoid code breakage when full mapped</span>
   <span class="s0">copying is implemented it is suggested PixelArray to PixelArray copies be</span>
   <span class="s0">only between surfaces of identical format.</span>

   <span class="s0">.. versionadded:: 1.9.4</span>

    <span class="s0">- close() method was added. For explicitly cleaning up.</span>
    <span class="s0">- being able to use PixelArray as a context manager for cleanup.</span>
    <span class="s0">- both of these are useful for when working without reference counting (pypy).</span>

    <span class="s0">- array struct interface</span>
    <span class="s0">- transpose method</span>

    <span class="s0">- A 2D PixelArray can have a length 1 dimension.</span>
      <span class="s0">Only an integer index on a 2D PixelArray returns a 1D array.</span>
    <span class="s0">- For assignment, a tuple can only be a color. Any other sequence type</span>
      <span class="s0">is a sequence of colors.</span>
