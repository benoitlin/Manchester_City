<span class="s0">:mod:`pygame.mixer`</span>
<span class="s0">===================</span>

<span class="s0">.. module:: pygame.mixer</span>
   <span class="s0">:synopsis: pygame module for loading and playing sounds</span>

<span class="s0">| :sl:`pygame module for loading and playing sounds`</span>

<span class="s0">This module contains classes for loading Sound objects and controlling</span>
<span class="s0">playback. The mixer module is optional and depends on SDL_mixer. Your program</span>
<span class="s0">should test that :mod:`pygame.mixer` is available and initialized before using</span>
<span class="s0">it.</span>

<span class="s0">The mixer module has a limited number of channels for playback of sounds.</span>
<span class="s0">Usually programs tell pygame to start playing audio and it selects an available</span>
<span class="s0">channel automatically. The default is 8 simultaneous channels, but complex</span>
<span class="s0">programs can get more precise control over the number of channels and their</span>
<span class="s0">use.</span>

<span class="s0">All sound playback is mixed in background threads. When you begin to play a</span>
<span class="s0">Sound object, it will return immediately while the sound continues to play. A</span>
<span class="s0">single Sound object can also be actively played back multiple times.</span>

<span class="s0">The mixer also has a special streaming channel. This is for music playback and</span>
<span class="s0">is accessed through the :mod:`pygame.mixer.music` module. Consider using this</span>
<span class="s0">module for playing long running music. Unlike mixer module, the music module</span>
<span class="s0">streams the music from the files without loading music at once into memory.</span>

<span class="s0">The mixer module must be initialized like other pygame modules, but it has some</span>
<span class="s0">extra conditions. The ``pygame.mixer.init()`` function takes several optional</span>
<span class="s0">arguments to control the playback rate and sample size. Pygame will default to</span>
<span class="s0">reasonable values, but pygame cannot perform Sound resampling, so the mixer</span>
<span class="s0">should be initialized to match the values of your audio resources.</span>

<span class="s0">``NOTE``: For less laggy sound use a smaller buffer size. The default</span>
<span class="s0">is set to reduce the chance of scratchy sounds on some computers. You can</span>
<span class="s0">change the default buffer by calling :func:`pygame.mixer.pre_init` before</span>
<span class="s0">:func:`pygame.mixer.init` or :func:`pygame.init` is called. For example:</span>
<span class="s0">``pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100,-16,2, 1024)``</span>


<span class="s0">.. function:: init</span>

   <span class="s0">| :sl:`initialize the mixer module`</span>
   <span class="s0">| :sg:`init(frequency=44100, size=-16, channels=2, buffer=512, devicename=None, allowedchanges=AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE | AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE) -&gt; None`</span>

   <span class="s0">Initialize the mixer module for Sound loading and playback. The default</span>
   <span class="s0">arguments can be overridden to provide specific audio mixing. Keyword</span>
   <span class="s0">arguments are accepted. For backwards compatibility, argument values of </span>
   <span class="s0">0 are replaced with the startup defaults, except for ``allowedchanges``,</span>
   <span class="s0">where -1 is used. (startup defaults may be changed by a :func:`pre_init` call).</span>

   <span class="s0">The size argument represents how many bits are used for each audio sample.</span>
   <span class="s0">If the value is negative then signed sample values will be used. Positive</span>
   <span class="s0">values mean unsigned audio samples will be used. An invalid value raises an</span>
   <span class="s0">exception.</span>

   <span class="s0">The channels argument is used to specify whether to use mono or stereo. 1</span>
   <span class="s0">for mono and 2 for stereo.</span>

   <span class="s0">The buffer argument controls the number of internal samples used in the</span>
   <span class="s0">sound mixer. The default value should work for most cases. It can be lowered</span>
   <span class="s0">to reduce latency, but sound dropout may occur. It can be raised to larger</span>
   <span class="s0">values to ensure playback never skips, but it will impose latency on sound</span>
   <span class="s0">playback. The buffer size must be a power of two (if not it is rounded up to</span>
   <span class="s0">the next nearest power of 2).</span>

   <span class="s0">Some platforms require the :mod:`pygame.mixer` module to be initialized</span>
   <span class="s0">after the display modules have initialized. The top level ``pygame.init()``</span>
   <span class="s0">takes care of this automatically, but cannot pass any arguments to the mixer</span>
   <span class="s0">init. To solve this, mixer has a function ``pygame.mixer.pre_init()`` to set</span>
   <span class="s0">the proper defaults before the toplevel init is used.</span>

   <span class="s0">When using allowedchanges=0 it will convert the samples at runtime to match</span>
   <span class="s0">what the hardware supports. For example a sound card may not</span>
   <span class="s0">support 16bit sound samples, so instead it will use 8bit samples internally.</span>
   <span class="s0">If AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE is supplied, then the requested format will</span>
   <span class="s0">change to the closest that SDL2 supports.</span>

   <span class="s0">Apart from 0, allowedchanged accepts the following constants ORed together:</span>

      <span class="s0">- AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE</span>
      <span class="s0">- AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE</span>
      <span class="s0">- AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE</span>
      <span class="s0">- AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE</span>

   <span class="s0">It is safe to call this more than once, but after the mixer is initialized</span>
   <span class="s0">you cannot change the playback arguments without first calling</span>
   <span class="s0">``pygame.mixer.quit()``.</span>

   <span class="s0">.. versionchanged:: 1.8 The default ``buffersize`` changed from 1024 to 3072.</span>
   <span class="s0">.. versionchanged:: 1.9.1 The default ``buffersize`` changed from 3072 to 4096.</span>

   <span class="s0">Call pre_init to change the defaults used when the real</span>
   <span class="s0">``pygame.mixer.init()`` is called. Keyword arguments are accepted. The best</span>
   <span class="s0">way to set custom mixer playback values is to call</span>
   <span class="s0">``pygame.mixer.pre_init()`` before calling the top level ``pygame.init()``.</span>

   <span class="s0">Load a new sound buffer from a filename, a python file object or a readable</span>
   <span class="s0">buffer object. Limited resampling will be performed to help the sample match</span>
   <span class="s0">the initialize arguments for the mixer. A Unicode string can only be a file</span>
   <span class="s0">pathname. A bytes object can be either a pathname or a buffer object.</span>
   <span class="s0">Use the 'file' or 'buffer' keywords to avoid ambiguity; otherwise Sound may</span>
   <span class="s0">guess wrong. If the array keyword is used, the object is expected to export </span>
   <span class="s0">a new buffer interface (The object is checked for a buffer interface first.)</span>

   <span class="s0">The Sound object represents actual sound sample data. Methods that change</span>
   <span class="s0">the state of the Sound object will the all instances of the Sound playback.</span>

   <span class="s0">Note: The buffer will be copied internally, no data will be shared between</span>
   <span class="s0">it and the Sound object.</span>

   <span class="s0">For now buffer and array support is consistent with ``sndarray.make_sound``</span>
   <span class="s0">for Numeric arrays, in that sample sign and byte order are ignored. This</span>
   <span class="s0">will change, either by correctly handling sign and byte order, or by raising</span>
   <span class="s0">an exception when different. Also, source samples are truncated to fit the</span>
   <span class="s0">audio sample size. This will not change.</span>

      <span class="s0">The loops argument controls how many times the sample will be repeated</span>
      <span class="s0">after being played the first time. A value of 5 means that the sound will</span>
      <span class="s0">be played once, then repeated five times, and so is played a total of six</span>
      <span class="s0">times. The default value (zero) means the Sound is not repeated, and so</span>
      <span class="s0">is only played once. If loops is set to -1 the Sound will loop</span>
      <span class="s0">indefinitely (though you can still call ``stop()`` to stop it).</span>

      <span class="s0">sound will be played 4 times (the first time, then three more). If loops</span>
      <span class="s0">is -1 then the playback will repeat indefinitely.</span>

      <span class="s0">As in ``Sound.play()``, the maxtime argument can be used to stop playback</span>
      <span class="s0">of the Sound after a given number of milliseconds.</span>

      <span class="s0">As in ``Sound.play()``, the fade_ms argument can be used fade in the</span>

      <span class="s0">| :sg:`set_volume(left, right) -&gt; None`</span>

      <span class="s0">Set the volume (loudness) of a playing sound. When a channel starts to</span>
      <span class="s0">play its volume value is reset. This only affects the current sound. The</span>
      <span class="s0">value argument is between 0.0 and 1.0.</span>

      <span class="s0">If one argument is passed, it will be the volume of both speakers. If two</span>
      <span class="s0">arguments are passed and the mixer is in stereo mode, the first argument</span>
      <span class="s0">will be the volume of the left speaker and the second will be the volume</span>
      <span class="s0">of the right speaker. (If the second argument is ``None``, the first</span>
      <span class="s0">argument will be the volume of both speakers.)</span>

      <span class="s0">If the channel is playing a Sound on which ``set_volume()`` has also been</span>
      <span class="s0">called, both calls are taken into account. For example:</span>

      <span class="s0">| :sl:`get the volume of the playing channel`</span>
      <span class="s0">| :sg:`get_volume() -&gt; value`</span>

      <span class="s0">Return the volume of the channel for the current playing sound. This does</span>
      <span class="s0">not take into account stereo separation used by</span>
      <span class="s0">:meth:`Channel.set_volume`. The Sound object also has its own volume</span>
      <span class="s0">which is mixed with the channel.</span>

      <span class="s0">Returns ``True`` if the channel is actively mixing sound. If the channel</span>
      <span class="s0">is idle this returns ``False``.</span>

      <span class="s0">When a Sound is queued on a Channel, it will begin playing immediately</span>
      <span class="s0">after the current Sound is finished. Each channel can only have a single</span>
      <span class="s0">Sound queued at a time. The queued Sound will only play if the current</span>
      <span class="s0">playback finished automatically. It is cleared on any other call to</span>

      <span class="s0">| :sg:`set_endevent(type) -&gt; None`</span>

      <span class="s0">When an endevent is set for a channel, it will send an event to the</span>
      <span class="s0">pygame queue every time a sound finishes playing on that channel (not</span>
      <span class="s0">just the first time). Use ``pygame.event.get()`` to retrieve the endevent</span>
      <span class="s0">once it's sent.</span>

      <span class="s0">Note that if you called ``Sound.play(n)`` or ``Channel.play(sound,n)``,</span>
      <span class="s0">the end event is sent only once: after the sound has been played &quot;n+1&quot;</span>
      <span class="s0">times (see the documentation of Sound.play).</span>

      <span class="s0">If ``Channel.stop()`` or ``Channel.play()`` is called while the sound was</span>
      <span class="s0">still playing, the event will be posted immediately.</span>

      <span class="s0">The type argument will be the event id sent to the queue. This can be any</span>
      <span class="s0">valid event type, but a good choice would be a value between</span>
      <span class="s0">``pygame.locals.USEREVENT`` and ``pygame.locals.NUMEVENTS``. If no type</span>
      <span class="s0">argument is given then the Channel will stop sending endevents.</span>

      <span class="s0">Returns the event type to be sent every time the Channel finishes</span>
