<span class="s0">is in the public domain.  Feel free to use for your own projects.</span>

<span class="s0">aliens.py</span>
   <span class="s0">This started off as a port of the SDL demonstration, Aliens.</span>
   <span class="s0">Now it has evolved into something sort of resembling fun.</span>
   <span class="s0">This demonstrates a lot of different uses of sprites and</span>
   <span class="s0">optimized blitting.  Also transparency, colorkeys, fonts, sound,</span>
   <span class="s0">music, joystick, and more.  (PS, my high score is 117! goodluck)</span>

<span class="s0">arraydemo.py</span>
   <span class="s0">Another example filled with various surfarray effects.</span>
   <span class="s0">It requires the surfarray and image modules to be installed.</span>
   <span class="s0">This little demo can also make a good starting point for any of</span>
   <span class="s0">your own tests with surfarray</span>

<span class="s0">audiocapture.py</span>
   <span class="s0">Record sound from a microphone, and play back the recorded sound.</span>

<span class="s0">eventlist.py</span>
   <span class="s0">Learn about pygame events and input.</span>
   <span class="s0">Watch the events fly by.  Click the mouse, and see the mouse</span>
   <span class="s0">event come up.  Press a keyboard key, and see the key up event.</span>

<span class="s0">font_viewer.py</span>
   <span class="s0">Display all available fonts in a scrolling window.</span>

<span class="s0">fonty.py</span>

   <span class="s0">8-bit setup (with colormap).</span>

<span class="s0">mask.py</span>
   <span class="s0">Single bit pixel manipulation.  Fast for collision detection,</span>

   <span class="s0">on the display.</span>

<span class="s0">sound.py</span>
